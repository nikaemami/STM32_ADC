# STM32_ADC
An implementation of an ARM analog to digital converter


A sine voltage source is connected to a micro controller, along with a 'Read' push button. When the push button is pushed, the ADC gets a sample from the voltage, and print the binary output along with the voltage value on a LCD display connected to the micro controller.
